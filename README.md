# sqlalchemy-challenge
For this challenge, we are looking at Hawaii's climate over the course of one year to determine which area will likely be best suited for a vacation! To do this, we use SQLAlchemy to query data and create an API app to call on that data.

I referenced this github repository for help building the start and start/end sections of the API: https://github.com/mjrotter4445/Surfs-Up/blob/main/app.py
